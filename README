Intel ICH7 gpio module for linux
--------------------------------

This allows access to the GPIO pins on the ICH7


Build Instructions
------------------

from within the source directory, run:
make modules
make modules_install


Usage Instructions
------------------

modprobe ich7_gpio

This creates a file within /proc called ich7_gpio

To see the current state of the gpio registers read this file

You can control the gpio registers by writing to the file:

echo 'cmd args' > /proc/ich7_gpio


Commands
--------

echo 'set reg value' > /proc/ich7_gpio

set the value of the register 'reg' to the value 'value'.  See the output of
cat /proc/ich7_gpio to see valid register names.  'value' is a decimal value.


echo 'setbit reg bitno value' > /proc/ich7_gpio

set a particular bit within the register 'reg' to either 1 or 0.


LED commands
------------

The module interfaces with the linux LED interface to allow you to create LEDs
based on the pins.  See the scripts directory for examples for this.  Currently
examples for the Thecus N5500 and N7700 NASs are provided.
